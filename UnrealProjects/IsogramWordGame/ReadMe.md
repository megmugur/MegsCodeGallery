I did this one as part of a Udemy course called Unreal Engine C++ Developer, taught by Ben Tristen, in association with Epic Games. Some of the basic setup and the 3D models were provided by the course creators. I worked out (programmed) the game logic, and so I am only presenting my contibution here.

Game description:
Player has to guess a word, an isogram (no repeating letters).
The number of attempts available is dependent on the length of the word.
Bull count is the number of guessed characters that are correct and in the correct position.
Cow count is the number of guessed characters that are correct but in the wrong position.

Here's a preview of the game in Unreal:
